# possible title 
Design and Implementation of a Smart Temperature Control System for Residential Buildings in Zimbabwe.


## technicial things 
* thermal heat 
* heat index 
* internet of things 
* easy of use 
* cost it must be a low cost 
* ambient temperature
## what the system does 

* monitor air temperature 
* regulate air temperature 
* the system will use natural ways and airtifical ways to maitain air temperature like opeing and closing windows 
* a fan will be used to lower the air temperature
* a case study based on the house holds in zimbabwe 
* the system will have a interface that is web based, 
* the system will have two modes of operation, manual and automatic

## introduction and  background information 



## research area 
- what is heat index 
- why air quality is important 
- is there a relationship between quality of study and air comfort 
- possible hy and low temp record in zim 
- heath issues related to heat 
- how does passive heat and cooling works 

 ## where can the system be used 
 - library 
 - office
 - homes 
 

 ## problem statement 
 - current situation 
 - ideal 
 - backmail 

 ## justification 
 - studence will be able to learn better 
 - its easy to control 
 - it save enerngy 
 - help people mitigate the challenges of heat 
 - the importance temperature regulation 
 - its a low cost project 
 
## heathy issues around it 
- the evidance that support that high heat lead to low productivity 
- it affewct the heath, the question is in wath ways 
-

The proposed system in this work will
help residence to manage their heating systems smartly in a costeffective way, which will be the replacement of the conventional
thermostat settings. The utility provider company can also use
this system to control the thermostat settings from centrally,
wirelessly, and remotely.

## chapter one 

introduction , 
- house hold temperture redulation 
- why it impotatn 
- background 
- purpose and scope 

* the scope of the project is to desing a system that will regulate the indoor temperture using active and passive means. With more emphase on making the solution low cost. The project will look as the mehtods that are used to redulate the indoor air temperature and comeup with a solutin that is best. The background is to try to find a better way to reduce the heat used by most applicated
